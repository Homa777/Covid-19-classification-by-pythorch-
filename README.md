# Covid-19-classification-by-pythorch

In this repository, I reviewed the respotiry created by Shervin Minaee, Milan Sonka (the previous editor in chief of IEEE TMI), Rahele Kafieh, Shakib Yazdani, and Ghazaleh Jamalipour Soufi, the pape is <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09363.pdf"> here </a> to make their work to a practical app. Besides, I separate their work to three sections so that it would be clear to undrestand. 


I also add some suggestion that improve the code. 

Besides, I adjust the code in a way that can be used in notebook which is more interactive, where you can run code, visualize data and include text all in one document

# Upload the whole dataset in jupyter notebook

We can upload the dataset including train dataset and test dataset:

<a href= "https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset"> covid-chestxray-dataset </a>   
<a href= "https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert"> ChexPert Dataset </a>  
in one single zip file in jupitor noteook, then extract it as folder in your notebook. By this way, you can upload whole dataset in your jupitor notebook.
